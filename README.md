# My Portfolio Website

**I'm a self-taught developer currently working on frontend. I learn web development from online course providers such as Coursera, Scrimba, Meta and from YouTube. Recently, I'm building up my portfolio websites using NextJS, TypeScript along with headless CMS such as Strapi.**
